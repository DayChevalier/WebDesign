<h2>TV and Movie Rolls</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the TV-movie <em>The Trial of the Incredible Hulk</em> (1989), Lee's first appearance in a Marvel movie or TV project is as a jury foreman in the trial of Dr. David Banner.</li>
	<li>In <em>X-Men</em> (2000), Lee appears as a hotdog stand vendor on the beach when Senator Kelly emerges naked onshore after escaping from Magneto.</li>
	<li>In <em>Spider-Man</em> (2002), he appeared during Spider-Man's first battle with the Green Goblin, pulling a little girl away from falling debris. In the DVD's deleted scenes, Lee has an expanded cameo in which he plays a street vendor who tries to sell Peter Parker a pair of sunglasses "just like the X-Men wear."</li>
	<li>In <em>Daredevil</em> (2003), as a child, Matt Murdock stops Lee from crossing the street and getting hit by a bus.</li>
	<li>In <em>Hulk</em> (2003), he appears walking alongside former TV-series Hulk Lou Ferrigno in an early scene, both as security guards at Bruce Banner's lab. It was his first speaking role in a film based on one of his characters.</li>
	<li>In <em>Spider-Man 2</em> (2004), Lee again pulls an innocent person away from danger during Spider-Man's first battle with Doctor Octopus. In a hidden scene shown in the bloopers section, Stan has another cameo, where he says "Look, Spider-man stole that child sneakers" but he messes up the last word.</li>
	<li>In <em>Fantastic 4</em> (2005), Lee appears for the first time as a character from the comics, in a role credited as Willie Lumpkin, the mail carrier who greets the Fantastic Four as they enter the Baxter Building.</li>
	<li>In <em>X-Men: The Last Stand</em> (2006), Lee and Chris Claremont appear as two of Jean Grey's neighbors in the opening scenes set 20 years ago. Lee, credited as "Waterhose man," is watering the lawn when Jean telekinetically redirects the water from the hose into the air.</li>
	<li>In <em>Spider-Man 3</em> (2007), Lee appears in a credited role as "Man in Times Square". He stands next to Peter Parker, both of them reading a news bulletin about Spider-Man, and commenting to Peter that, "You know, I guess one person can make a difference". He then says his catch phrase, "'Nuff said."</li>
	<li>In <em>Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer</em> (2007), Lee appears as himself at Reed Richards' and Susan Storm's first wedding, being turned away by a security guard for not being on the guest list. In Fantastic Four Annual No.3 (1965), in which the couple married, Lee and Jack Kirby are similarly turned away.</li>
	<li>In <em>Iron Man</em> (2008), Lee (credited as "Himself") appears at a gala cavorting with three blond women, where Tony Stark mistakes him for Hugh Hefner. In the theatrical release of the film, Stark simply greets Lee as "Hef" and moves on without seeing Lee's face; another version of the scene was filmed where Stark realizes his mistake, but Lee graciously responds, "That's okay, I get this all the time."</li>
	<li>In <em>The Incredible Hulk</em> (2008), Lee appears as a hapless citizen who accidentally ingests a soft drink mixed with Bruce Banner's blood, leading to the discovery of Dr. Banner's location in a bottling plant in Brazil.</li>
	<li>In <em>Iron Man 2</em> (2010), during the Stark Expo, Lee, wearing suspenders and a red shirt and black and purple tie, is greeted by Tony Stark as "Larry King".</li>
	<li>In <em>Thor</em> (2011), Lee appears among many people at the site where Thor's hammer Mjolnir lands on earth. He tears the back off his pickup truck in an attempt to pull Mjolnir out of the ground with a chain and causes everyone to laugh by asking, "Did it work?".</li>
	<li>In <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em> (2011), Lee is again used as comic relief, this time portraying a general in World War II. When Captain America/Steve Rogers is queued to a stage to receive an award, a man goes on stage to tell the presenter that Rogers will not be attending. The general mistakes the man for Rogers, commenting, "I thought he'd be taller."</li>
	<li>In <em>The Avengers</em> (2012), Lee will have a cameo unless the filmmakers "shoot it on the moon".</li>
	<li>In <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em> (2012), Lee is scheduled to have a cameo in an action scene where he plays a librarian oblivious to the fight between Spider-Man and the Lizard happening behind him.</li>
