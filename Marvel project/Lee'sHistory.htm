<h2>A Writer's History</h2>
<p>Stan Lee was born Stanley Martin Lieber on December 28, 1922, in his Jewish Romanian immigrant parents' Manhattan apartment. His father worked only sporadically after the Great Depression, forcing them to move into worse and worse living conditions. By the time he was in his teens, his family was living in a one room apartment in the Bronx. He shared said room with his younger brother Larry Lieber, born when Stanley was 9, while their parents used a foldout couch. Even so, he claims his childhood was rather enjoyable, highly influenced by such heroic actors as Errol Flynn.</p>

</br><p>Lee attended high school in the Bronx. At which time he was a voracious reader who enjoyed writing even as a teen. He claims to have worked many part time jobs such as writing obituaries and press releases for various news serices. He graduated at 16 in 1939, joining the WPA Federal Theatre Project shortly after.</p>

<p>That same year, with his uncle's help, Lee became an assistant at the new Timely Comics division of pulp magazine and comic-book publisher Martin Goodman's company. Timely, by the 1960s, would evolve into Marvel Comics. Lee, whose cousin Jean was Goodman's wife, was formally hired by Timely editor Joe Simon.</p>

</br><p>His duties were prosaic at first, getting the artists their lunch, proofreading, and erasing the pencils from the finished pages. Aiding his childhood ambition to be a writer, young Stanley made his comic-book debut with the text filler "Captain America Foils the Traitor's Revenge" in Captain America Comics #3 (May 1941), using the pseudonym "Stan Lee", which years later would bed adopted as his legal name. Lee later explained in his autobiography and numerous other sources that he had intended to save his given name for more literary work. His first story also introduced Captain America's trademark ricocheting shield-toss, which immediately became one of the character's signatures.</p>

<p>He graduated from writing filler to actual comics with a backup feature, "'Headline' Hunter, Foreign Correspondent", two issues later. Lee's first superhero co-creation was the Destroyer, in Mystic Comics #6 (Aug 1941).</p>

<p>When Simon and his creative partner Jack Kirby left late in 1941, following a dispute with Goodman, the 30-year-old publisher installed Lee, just under 19 years old, as interim editor. The youngster showed a knack for the business that led him to remain as the comic-book division's editor-in-chief, as well as art director, until 1972, when he would succeed Goodman as publisher.</p>

</br><p>Lee entered the US Amry in 1942 and served stateside in the Signal Corps, writing manuals, training films, slogans, and occasionally cartooning. His military class was "playwright"; supposedly only nine men in the U.S. Army were given this title. Vincent Fago, editor of Timely's humorous "animation comics" section, filled in until Lee returned from his World War II service in 1945. Lee now lived in the rented top floor of a brownstone in East Manhattan.</p>

<p>He married Joan Boocock on December 5, 1947. The couple soon bought a home in Woodmere, New York on Long Island, living there through 1952 when they had moved again to Hewlett Harbor. Inwhich time the couple had daughter Joan Celia "J.C." Lee, born in 1950; another child, Jan Lee, died three days after delivery in 1953. They remained there until 1980, in which time the company would slowly became Atlus Comics and soon after Marvel. It was in this time that Lee, along with a number of artists such as Jack Kirby, would write the first stories for the Fantastic Four, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, the X-Men, and of course Spider-Man.</p>
